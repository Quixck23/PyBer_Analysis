# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
Per request of our CEO, this report summarizes how our data differs by city type, and those differences can be used by at Pyber

## PythonData Environment
1. Anaconda
2. Jupyter-Notebook 
3. Python
4. Numpy 
5. Matplotlib

## Results
# Merged DataFrame

The merged of two data frames revealed important count and average percentages information. highly needed for decision making to our stakeholders.

***Findings***
1. Rural had the highest average of fare per driver, but had the least count of rides overall. 
2. Urban had more drivers than rides. which caused them to decrease their average fare per ride and fare per driver, giving a possible mistaken information.
3. suburban was the steadiest area in which it developed fairly okay. 

# Total Fare per City Type
From January to the end of April

***Findings***
1. All 3 areas had a peak in the last week of February.
2. Rural areas shows steady conservative growth 
3. Urban areas show explosive growth since the beginning, but there is some fluctuation between mid-February and mid-March.
4. Suburban areas shows a comprehensive steady grow, also with a peak on Feb with an slightly increment at the end of April.

## Summary

1. Although rural areas show the least drivers, it could be considered an opportunity to gain more users and drivers in the area while showing steady growth. 
2. Urban had the largest amount of drivers and profits, however we can deduce that many drivers are either not finding passengers or there is not enough users. In our next data analysis, we should remove drivers without a ride to get a clearer picture of urban areas. Also, if we could determine what happened at the end of February, that made all areas had a peak. could be because of a holiday, such as Valentine's Day.
3. Suburban shows steady growth with an acceptable ratio of numbers of drivers and rides. We could analyze to compare with other areas and investigate what they did well compared with other areas.
